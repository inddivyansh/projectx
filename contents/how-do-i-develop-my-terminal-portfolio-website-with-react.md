Automated damage detection on heritage sites and monuments is crucial for preservation efforts. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great promise in analyzing images to identify and classify various types of damage, such as cracks, erosion, or structural deformations.

## Introduction

Heritage sites and monuments are vulnerable to natural and human-induced damage. Manual inspection is time-consuming and subjective. By leveraging CNNs, we can automate the process of detecting and assessing damage from photographic data, enabling faster and more consistent monitoring.

## Methodology

The approach involves collecting a dataset of images of heritage sites, annotated with types and locations of damage. A CNN model is trained to classify and localize damage within these images.

- **Data Collection:** High-resolution images of monuments are gathered from multiple sources and annotated for damage.
- **Model Architecture:** Popular CNN architectures like ResNet or VGG are adapted for damage detection tasks.
- **Training:** The model is trained on labeled data, using techniques such as data augmentation to improve robustness.
- **Evaluation:** Performance is measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and IoU (Intersection over Union) for localization tasks.

## Features

Key features of the CNN-based damage detection system include:

### Automated Damage Classification

The system can distinguish between different types of damage, such as cracks, biological growth, or surface erosion, directly from images.

### Localization and Visualization

Detected damage areas are highlighted on the images, providing visual feedback for conservation teams.

### Scalable Monitoring

Large numbers of images from drones or handheld cameras can be processed efficiently, enabling regular and scalable monitoring of heritage sites.

## Results

Initial experiments show that CNN-based models can achieve high accuracy in detecting and classifying damage, significantly reducing the workload for manual inspectors.

## Conclusion

CNN-based image analysis offers a powerful tool for heritage conservation, enabling proactive and data-driven maintenance of valuable sites and monuments.
