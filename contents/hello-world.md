In this post, Iâ€™ll share how I built the open-source Machine Learning Playground application.

## Tech Stack

The application is built with ReactJS for the frontend, using CSS for styling. JavaScript powers the core machine learning algorithms and data visualizations, while React state management enables interactive experimentation. The project is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/inddivyansh/physics-simulator).

## Features

Key features of the application include:

- Interactive Machine Learning Model Training and Visualization
- Real-time Data Manipulation and Experimentation
- Multiple Algorithms (e.g. Linear Regression, Classification)
- Visual Feedback for Model Performance
- Customizable Parameters and Datasets
- Responsive Design for all devices
- Open-source

## Conclusion

Machine Learning Playground was developed using React and JavaScript to make machine learning concepts interactive and visual. You can explore the source code on GitHub.
