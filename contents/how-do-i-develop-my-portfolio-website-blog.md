My journey developing a personalized stock prediction dashboard using machine learning, Zerodha MCP server, and a React frontend.

## Motivation

Stock market prediction has always intrigued me, especially with the rise of AI and real-time data APIs. I set out to build a project that combines my interests in finance, machine learning, and modern web development—a personalized dashboard for AI-powered stock predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript) for a dynamic, component-driven UI
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI) for serving ML models and handling data
- **Data Source:** Zerodha MCP server for real-time market data
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS for responsive design
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render/Heroku (backend)
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Features

### Real-time Stock Data Integration

The dashboard connects to Zerodha's MCP server, fetching live market data for accurate and timely predictions.

### Machine Learning Models

Custom ML models analyze historical and real-time data to forecast stock prices and trends.

### Personalized Dashboard

Users can customize their dashboard—selecting stocks, viewing prediction charts, and tracking performance.

### Responsive & Accessible UI

Built with React and TailwindCSS, the interface is mobile-friendly and accessible.

### Secure API Communication

All data exchanges between frontend, backend, and Zerodha APIs are secured and optimized for performance.

## Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of integrating financial APIs, building robust ML pipelines, and designing user-centric dashboards. I learned to handle real-time data streams, manage API authentication, and optimize React apps for performance and usability.
